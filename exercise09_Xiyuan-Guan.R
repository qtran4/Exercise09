# Do the bar and scatter plots tell you different stories? Why?
# The bar and scatter plots tell different stories. 
# The scatter plot shows how data distribute along observations, as the "alpha" aesthetic makes it clearer to see the density.
# In east region, the observations tend to be normally distributed, with high frequencies in the middle and low frequencies on both sides.
# In north region, the observations are uniform and concentrated distributed.
# In south region, the observations are divided into two parts, with the upper part being more sparse and the lower part more concentrated.
# In west region, the observations are uniform and sparse distributed.
# The bar plot only shows the mean observations of four populations, where 4 populations have very similar mean values. 
# However, I think the boxplot is better to use here to show the sparsity and dispersion by the range of boxes, and to compare with the jitter plot.
# It's good at showing the mean value of the observations, but is weak at representing the real distribution.
